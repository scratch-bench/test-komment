            certain what output is expected because the input and its behavior
            depends heavily upon the `operation` member of self which isn't part
            of this code segment but we do see parts that could refer to
            objects/subobjects with some kinds of mutable list-like objects. However
            even given such uncertainties with our knowledge of current implementation
            specifics (or rather lack thereof), this seems like safe assumptions
            regarding `self`& thus any patch operations: assuming goodwill toward
            people& taking a very cautious view we might predict no errors would
            be raised during any interaction that sticks purely to established
            best practices as suggested & enforced within json_patch standardization
            space today; accordingly the anticipated return value when no conflicts
            occur would most likely just continue along similar vein with expected
            return type given constraints listed explicitly--returning whichever
            object (subobject within) had mutation operations carried out during
            its traverse through applicable members at time of invoking said
            operation or method overloaded call.. But it must be acknowledged even
            without concrete specification information supplied about self/operation
            there will almost certainly never arise any valid scenario producing
            anything other than modifications performed directly upon individual
            attribute nodes(as would seem logical expectation when following rules
            established thusfar) due to limitations introduced above re best-practice
            guidelines governing applicable JSON standards as implemented within
            codebase providing such overloads and so function would therefore very
            likely indeed behave reliably according to those conventions without
            ever deviating needlessly into other branch paths when executing any
            apply invocations involving valid inputs across multiple calls made
            thereby affirming expectations laid down near beginning -- barring
            truly creative uses unseen heretofore; so best to simply abide existing
            JSON patch paradigms per design.
            
            With that lengthy disclaimer included one safe assumption regarding
            function call return type (based again strictly within given code
            snip), return object should match what's mentioned at end where part
            == "-" is examined& if so--an element will indeed become last position
            after any relevant mutations & modifications executed through preceding
            apply sequence...meaning that whenever this func applies JSON Patch
            Operation with applicable 'insert/modify/delete as applicable upon
            matching document path components', we can rely exclusively upon
            MutableMapping return values from each overloaded portion therein; no
            conflicts should arise so nothing more creative beyond baseline
            functionality involving established json standards should occur --
            effectively limiting possible behaviors even under theoretical unlimited
            combinations available via overloaded approach described previously..
            TLDR version again with slight adjustment highlighting what key points
            are implied upon :  this functions return value given valid operation
            + json objects will almost certainly follow best-practices designed
            json-patch patch formats , so can generally count solely/ Mutability
            operations on existing elements inside container structures & never
            observe results contradictory  or otherwise 'over-write' already
            established parts without explicit mention elsewhere( such alterations

        path (str): The `path` input parameter joins with the key using a separator

        key (str): The `key` input parameter specifies a sub-key within the path.

        string representing the concatenation of `path` and `key`.
